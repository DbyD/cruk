					<p>Our ambition is like no other, it’s big and it’s exciting. But if we want to reach 3 in 4 by 2034, we must do things differently, make brave moves, be prepared to take risks, but also learn from our mistakes. So regardless of what role you’re in, don’t be afraid to challenge the status quo, or let fear hold you back. </p>
					<p>Every step we take towards accomplishing this ambition relies on every hour and every person – you are part of the journey that will bring forward the day when all cancers are cured. </p>
					<p>Our Beliefs are extremely important in helping us reach our ambition, helping accelerate our progress. The “Our Heroes” recognition programme, gives you the opportunity to recognise and celebrate the fantastic work that our staff do every day. Each time you nominate a colleague for doing something special, we ask that you associate the nomination with one of our Beliefs. </p>

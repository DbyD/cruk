							<h3>What is "Our Heroes"?</h3>
							The "Our Heroes: Extraordinary People, Extraordinary Effort" scheme gives all staff the opportunity to recognise the great work done by colleagues every day. You can recognise any peer, manager or report across the charity, with a simple thanks online or by nominating someone for a 'Little Extra' award to acknowledge extra special effort. In addition, an annual award ceremony takes place each December, recognising the best of the best and celebrating our top heroes who have really pushed the boundaries of their role to help beat cancer sooner. </li>
						<li><a name="b"></a>
							<h3>What form does the recognition take?</h3>
							There are three forms of recognition, ranging from a simple 'thank you' for a job well done, to an award with a 'Little Extra', when your nominee has done something beyond expectations, to a nomination for an Annual Our Heroes Award, for exceptional and outstanding performance.
							<h4>A simple 'thank you'</h4>
							Nominees will receive an e-card or, for those colleagues without a work email address, a printed congratulatory card and their contribution will be posted on the Our Heroes site 'Wall of Fame'.
							<h4>An award with a 'Little Extra'</h4>
							In addition to a card, nominees receive a 'Little Extra' to accompany their award. This means that your colleague will receive a choice of voucher, experience and/or work-based reward, which they can redeem through the Our Heroes site.
							<h4>An Annual Award </h4>
							The pan-charity annual award ceremony takes place in December. This is a chance to celebrate and recognise those who have shown outstanding performance and deserve an extra special form of recognition. There is a submission window each autumn for Annual Award nominations. </li>
						<li><a name="c"></a>
							<h3>How do I nominate?</h3>
							<h4>A simple 'thank you' or award with a 'Little Extra'</h4>
							Log onto the "Our Heroes" site and visit the 'Nominate' page, where you can follow the process to nominate either an individual or team of your choice.
							<p>You will need to nominate colleagues against one of our three belief categories and write why their contribution makes them worthy of an award. Once submitted, all contributions will be posted on the Our Heroes site 'Wall of Fame' and will be shared with the individual / team members you nominate and their manager(s). </p>
							<p>To add a 'Little Extra' award, select the button in the nominate page. You'll need to explain why you think the nominee deserves this special level of recognition. Your nomination will be sent for approval by the person's Head or Senior Manager.</p>
							<h4>An Annual Award </h4>
							There is a submission window each autumn for Annual Award nominations. The process is straightforward:
							<ul>
								<li>Visit the 'Annual Our Heroes Award' page on the Our Heroes site</li>
								<li>Enter your details and the person or team you want to nominate</li>
								<li>Nominate them against one of the annual award categories</li>
								<li>Write a clear example showing why you think that person/team deserves to be nominated for an Annual Our Heroes Award.</li>
								<li>Really sell them! Remember that the staff panel who are reading this nomination may not know this person or team, or what they've done, so you need to spell out why they are fantastic. Overall what exactly makes them stand out? How do they really live the brand? Keep this in mind when you are writing your nomination.</li>
								<li>Click submit!</li>
							</ul>
							Once the nomination deadline has passed, a volunteer staff panel will review each of the nominations and select the tops nominations, which are deserving of an Annual Our Heroes Extraordinary People Extraordinary Effort Award.
							<p>Winners receive a special tailored Annual Our Heroes award from an Executive Board member when the ceremony takes place.</p>

							<h3>Can I nominate someone in the year round programme <em>and</em> for an Annual Our Heroes Award? </h3>
							Yes you can. </li>
						<li><a name="e"></a>
							<h3>Who can I nominate?</h3>
							You can nominate as many individuals or teams as you like, at any grade and in any role or directorate. Unfortunately, this recognition scheme does not include volunteers, interns, casual workers or contractors. If you would like to nominate a volunteer, then visit the 'Flame of Hope' intranet page to find out more.   </li>
						<li><a name="f"></a>
							<h3>Can I nominate my manager?</h3>
							Yes, you can recognise and nominate any member of staff across the charity regardless of grade, team or directorate. </li>
						<li><a name="g"></a>
							<h3>Can I donate my 'Little Extra' award back to Cancer Research UK?</h3>
							Unfortunately, it is not possible for us to donate awards back to the charity. The administration involved would not be cost efficient for the charity and it also causes issues from a financial auditing perspective.
							<p>However, if you don't wish to accept your 'Little Extra' award, you can email the ourheroes@cancer.org.uk email address, to let us know.</p>
						</li>
						<li><a name="h"></a>
							<h3>Why does the Head or Senior Manager of the person I want to recognise need to authorise a nomination with an additional award attached?</h3>
							Heads or Senior Managers authorise all nominations with a 'Little Extra' award, so that they know who is being recognised in their team and can ensure that there are no exceptional circumstances that might make it inappropriate to offer the award. </li>
						<li><a name="i"></a>
							<h3>What if my Head or Senior Manager doesn't approve a nomination for a 'Little Extra' award?</h3>
							In the very unlikely event that this does happen, we will send the nominator a message to explain why the award has been declined. </li>
						<li><a name="j"></a>
							<h3>Where does the money come from?</h3>
							There is a central budget which has been approved by the Executive Board to be used to recognise the extraordinary effort of our staff. </li>
						<li><a name="k"></a>
							<h3>How do I redeem my 'Little Extra' award?</h3>
							Redeeming your award couldn't be easier! Once you receive an email from our reward and benefits suppliers, Xexec, just follow these steps...
							<ol>
								<li>Click on the link in your Xexec email which will send you to the "Our Heroes" site. You will need to login in order to redeem your award.</li>
								<li>Once into your personalised homepage, click on the redeem tile and you'll be guided through the process of choosing and redeeming your award.</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li><a name="l"></a>
							<h3>What if I don't have access to the Our Heroes website?</h3>
							If you work in Trading and don't have a work email address, your award will be sent in the post to your shop. To redeem your award, you can either:
							<ol>
								<li>Call the Xexec team on 020 8201 6483 or <a href="mailto:contactus@xexec.com">contactus@xexec.com</a> .</li>

						<li><a name="m"></a>
							<h3>Does the Our Heroes recognition scheme replace other directorate recognition events and thank you forums?</h3>
							No, this scheme has been set up to work alongside directorate led recognition events as another form of recognition. There is no intention to stop all the successful directorate or team led forms of recognition that are carried out across CRUK.   </li>
						<li><a name="n"></a>
							<h3>Do these recognition nominations go towards our directorate award events, e.g. the F&amp;M Away Day?</h3>
							The Our Heroes scheme has been designed to work alongside directorate award events. If you would like to use the nominations that have been uploaded onto the Our Heroes site then you are more than welcome to do so. All the nominations can be found under the 'Wall of Fame' page.   </li>
						<li><a name="o"></a>
							<h3>Who do I contact if I have a problem or want to get in touch with someone?</h3>
							If you have questions about using the "Our Heroes" site (for example you are having problems nominating, approving or redeeming an award) contact the Xexec team on 020 8201 6483.
							<p>If you would like to get in touch about anything else to do with the recognition scheme then contact <a href="mailto:ourheroes@cancer.org.uk">ourheroes@cancer.org.uk</a></p>
